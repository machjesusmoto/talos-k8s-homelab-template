# Session Context - July 10, 2025

## Session Summary
Continued from previous session where cluster stability issues were resolved. This session focused on ArgoCD troubleshooting and teaching.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. ArgoCD Troubleshooting and Education
- **Issue**: ArgoCD applications stuck in "Progressing" or "Degraded" state due to DNS resolution timeouts
- **Root Cause**: Application controller experiencing intermittent DNS timeouts when resolving internal services
- **Solution**: Restarted all ArgoCD components to clear DNS cache
- **Teaching Points**:
  - How to install and configure ArgoCD CLI
  - Using `argocd app list`, `argocd app sync`, and `argocd app get` commands
  - Understanding sync vs health status
  - Troubleshooting ComparisonError issues

### 2. DNS Resolution Investigation
- Discovered kubectl was not configured (missing KUBECONFIG export)
- Confirmed CoreDNS was functioning correctly
- Identified DNS search domains were properly configured
- Issue was intermittent timeouts, not complete DNS failure

### 3. Security Analysis
- Investigated blocked IPs on firewall (Contabo VPS addresses)
- Determined these were internet-wide port scans, not targeted attacks
- Confirmed security posture is good:
  - No port forwarding configured
  - All services on private IPs
  - Firewall correctly blocking unsolicited inbound traffic

### 4. Application Fixes
- Synced all OutOfSync applications
- Removed unused qbittorrent-vpn deployment
- Fixed code-server Traefik API version issue
- Current status: 6/16 applications fully healthy, others stabilizing

## Current Cluster State
- All nodes healthy and operational
- ArgoCD functioning correctly after restart
- Most applications deployed and running
- Some pods still stabilizing after sync operations

## Environment Details
- Working in WSL on Windows
- Preparing to migrate to CachyOS native Linux
- kubectl configured with ~/.kube/config
- ArgoCD CLI installed and configured

## Next Steps for CachyOS
User is migrating from WSL to native CachyOS Linux installation.
